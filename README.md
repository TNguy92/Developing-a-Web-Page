# Developing-a-Web-Page
Develop a Javascript application that allows the user to enter strings into a variable number of input widgets. As a string is entered by the user its length is automatically displayed next to the input widget. Buttons are provided to control the interface and to provide some functionality. 

• Clicking one button will add another input widget 
• Clicking another button will remove an input widget, always leaving at least one input widget. 
• Clicking anther button will cause the visible strings to be sorted 

As a convenience to the user, the application will remember the string entered into a widget even after the widget is removed. If the widget is added back again, then the saved value will be displayed in the widget. But, be careful, the saved strings do not participate in a sort operation if not visible. 
Provide styling that will approximately center the visible components. Also, change the default color for the background. 
Organize the application in three files: the HTML file that is the user interface to the application; a file with most of the Javascript code; a file with the styling rules.
